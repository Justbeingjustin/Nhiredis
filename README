<h2>Introduction</h2>

Nhiredis is lighweight .NET wrapper for hiredis. 

<h2>Alternatives .NET Redis Clients</h2>

There are two recommended .NET redis clients on redis.io - ServiceStack.Redis and BookSleeve. 
Why another client?

<b>ServiceStack.Redis</b> - This is the client I have been successfully using for some time. 
Unfortunately WATCH functionality isn't currently supported. One option was to add support to
this library, however there are two other things I don't like so much about this library: 

<ol>
<li>There are too many functions all in a single namespace and there isn't a clear mapping from Redis commands to the function names.</li>
<li>Too many dependencies. I just want a lightweight redis client, nothing else.</li>
</ol>

<b>Booksleeve</b> - Haven't looked in detail, but on the surface it looks great. However,
for people still working with C# 3, it's not an option.

<h2>Building</h2>

update the hiredis_wrapper_win32 project 'include directories' and 'additional dependencies' to
point to the hiredis source directory and successfully built .lib.

antirez/hiredis on github currently does not build on Windows. I recommend my fork (mhowlett/hiredis),
which is the version I use in conjunction with Nhiredis.
